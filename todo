remove all references to $HOME/.dotfiles (this may require stowing more things to .config)
finish the pkgbuild (find a folder where to place the dotfiles)
decide how to install plugins, use AUR?
restore ycm settings (ultisnips?)
move all user init things to user systemd services (and enable them by default: like: systemctl --user status ssh-agent)
write down all the installed dependencies, remember about acpi
